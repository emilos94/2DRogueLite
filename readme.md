# Action roguelite
This repo contains the source for a 2d roguelite action game developed in c using GLFW and OpenGL for window management and rendering.

## Project setup
The project is split into two submodules 'engine' and 'game' and uses a jumbo/unity build approach to compile each into a single compilation unit.
